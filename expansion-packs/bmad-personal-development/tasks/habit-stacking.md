# Habit Stacking Task

## Purpose

Build powerful habit chains by linking new behaviors to established routines, leveraging existing neural pathways to make habit formation automatic and effortless.

## Instructions

### 1. Current Habit Inventory

#### Existing Habit Identification
**Morning Habits** (things you always do):
- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Check phone
- Use bathroom
- Brush teeth
- Shower
- Get dressed
- Make coffee/tea
- Eat breakfast
- Check email

**Afternoon/Evening Habits**:
- Lunch routine
- Afternoon break
- Commute home
- Change clothes
- Prepare dinner
- Watch TV
- Brush teeth
- Get into bed
- Set alarm

**Strong Habit Anchors** (never miss these):
Identify 3-5 rock-solid habits

### 2. New Habit Selection

#### Desired Habits to Add
List habits you want to build:
- Health habits
- Productivity habits
- Learning habits
- Relationship habits
- Mindfulness habits

#### Habit Prioritization
**Criteria for Selection**:
- Impact on life (1-10)
- Ease of implementation (1-10)
- Time required (<5 min ideal)
- Dependency on location
- Equipment needed

### 3. Stack Design Principles

#### The Habit Stacking Formula
"After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

Examples:
- "After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for one minute."
- "After I sit down at my desk, I will write my three priorities."
- "After I close my laptop for lunch, I will do 10 pushups."

#### Stack Architecture Rules
1. **Anchor Strength**: Use unbreakable habits as anchors
2. **Natural Flow**: New habit should flow logically
3. **Time Match**: Similar duration habits work best
4. **Location Logic**: Same location reduces friction
5. **Energy Alignment**: Match energy levels

### 4. Stack Building Process

#### Phase 1: Single Stack (Week 1-2)
Add ONE new habit to strong anchor:
1. Choose strongest anchor habit
2. Select easiest new habit
3. Make it tiny (2 minutes max)
4. Practice immediately after anchor
5. Track completion daily

#### Phase 2: Stack Expansion (Week 3-4)
Add second habit to chain:
1. Original anchor
2. First new habit (now established)
3. Second new habit
4. Keep chain under 10 minutes total

#### Phase 3: Multiple Stacks (Week 5-6)
Create separate chains:
- Morning stack
- Workday stack
- Evening stack
- Weekend stack

### 5. Implementation Strategies

#### Friction Reduction
**Make It Obvious**:
- Visual cues placed strategically
- Written stack sequence visible
- Phone reminders at trigger time
- Accountability partner aware

**Make It Easy**:
- Prep everything night before
- Reduce steps required
- Start with 30-second version
- Remove decision-making

**Make It Satisfying**:
- Immediate reward after completion
- Visual progress tracking
- Celebration ritual
- Share wins with others

### 6. Common Stack Templates

#### Morning Power Stack
1. Wake up → Make bed (anchor)
2. Make bed → Drink water (new)
3. Drink water → 5 pushups (new)
4. Pushups → Gratitude (new)
5. Gratitude → Plan day (new)
Total time: 5 minutes

#### Work Focus Stack
1. Sit at desk → Clear workspace (anchor)
2. Clear workspace → Review goals (new)
3. Review goals → Time block calendar (new)
4. Time block → Start timer (new)
Total time: 10 minutes

#### Evening Wind-Down Stack
1. Close laptop → Journal (new)
2. Journal → Prep tomorrow (new)
3. Prep tomorrow → Read (new)
4. Read → No screens (new)
Total time: 30 minutes

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### Common Problems & Solutions
**Forgetting the stack**:
- Make anchor more obvious
- Set location-based reminder
- Add physical cue

**Stack too ambitious**:
- Reduce to one habit
- Make habit smaller
- Simplify sequence

**Timing conflicts**:
- Choose different anchor
- Adjust stack timing
- Create flexibility rule

2. [Habit] - Daily occurrence

## New Habits to Stack

### Priority 1: [Habit Name]
- **Why Important**: [Reason]
- **Time Required**: [X] minutes
- **Best Anchor**: [Chosen anchor]
- **Stack Formula**: "After I [anchor], I will [new habit]"

[Similar structure]

## My Habit Stacks

### Morning Stack (Total: [X] minutes)
1. [Anchor]: [Time]
   ↓
2. [New Habit 1]: [Duration]
   ↓
3. [New Habit 2]: [Duration]
   ↓
4. [Celebration]: [Reward]

## Tracking Dashboard

|-----|---------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Mon | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Smooth! |
| Tue | ✓ | ✓ | ⨯ | Tired evening |
[Continue for week]

2. [Potential issue]: [Solution]

### Adjustment Triggers

## 30-Day Vision

By [Date + 30 days], I will have:
- Established [X] new habits
- Completed stacks [X]% of days
- Integrated habits into identity
- Ready for next expansion

## Commitment Statement
I commit to following my habit stacks daily, starting small, and building consistently. I understand that missing one day doesn't break the chain, and I'll get back on track immediately.
```

## Stack Success Principles

### Start Tiny
- 30 seconds to 2 minutes max initially
- Build consistency before intensity
- Success breeds success
- Momentum matters most

### Never Miss Twice
- One miss is accident
- Two misses is pattern starting
- Get back on track immediately
- Lower bar if needed

### Celebrate Small Wins
- Acknowledge every completion
- Feel pride in consistency
- Share progress with others
- Track visually

### Iterate and Improve
- Weekly stack review
- Adjust timing as needed
- Add habits gradually
- Remove what doesn't work
