# Habit Breaking Task

## Purpose

Systematically eliminate unwanted habits using evidence-based techniques including substitution, gradual reduction, environmental modification, and cognitive restructuring.

## Instructions

### 1. Habit Assessment

#### Target Habit Identification
**The Habit to Break**: Be specific
- Exact behavior
- Frequency (times per day/week)
- Duration (how long engaged)
- Context (when/where/with whom)
- History (how long you've had it)

#### Impact Analysis
**Negative Consequences**:
- Health impacts
- Time wasted
- Money spent
- Relationships affected
- Goals blocked
- Self-esteem impact

**Hidden Benefits** (why it persists):
- Stress relief
- Boredom cure
- Social connection
- Identity reinforcement
- Avoidance mechanism
- Comfort/pleasure

### 2. Breaking Strategy Selection

#### Strategy Options
**Cold Turkey** (Immediate cessation):
- Best for: Clearly harmful habits
- Requires: High motivation, support
- Risk: High relapse rate

**Gradual Reduction** (Tapering):
- Best for: Physical dependencies
- Requires: Tracking, discipline
- Risk: Slow progress

**Substitution** (Replacement):
- Best for: Habits meeting real needs
- Requires: Alternative behavior ready
- Risk: Choosing poor substitute

**Environmental Design**:
- Best for: Convenience habits
- Requires: Control over environment
- Risk: Different environments

**Cognitive Restructuring**:
- Best for: Thought-driven habits
- Requires: Mental work
- Risk: Intellectual only

### 3. The STOP Method

#### S - Substitute
Find healthier replacement:
- Meets same need
- Available immediately
- More aligned with values
- Sustainable long-term

#### T - Track
Monitor the habit:
- Frequency tracking
- Trigger logging
- Impact measurement
- Progress visualization

#### O - Obstacles
Add friction:
- Make it harder
- Add steps
- Remove triggers
- Create barriers

#### P - Positive
Focus on gains:
- What you're gaining
- Identity shifting to
- Future benefits
- Current wins

### 4. Breaking Techniques

#### Urge Surfing
When craving hits:
1. Notice urge arising
2. Observe without judgment
3. Breathe through it
4. Watch it peak
5. Let it pass (usually 15-20 min)
6. Celebrate resistance

#### The 5-Minute Rule
When tempted:
- Wait 5 minutes before acting
- Often urge passes
- If not, wait another 5
- Build delay tolerance
- Reduce impulsivity

#### Replacement Planning
**If-Then Scenarios**:
- "If I want to [bad habit], then I will [replacement] instead"
- "If I feel [trigger], then I will [alternative action]"
- "If I'm in [situation], then I will [escape plan]"

### 5. Support Systems

#### Accountability Structure
- Tell someone your goal
- Daily check-ins
- Progress sharing
- Slip-up confession
- Celebration partner

#### Environmental Allies
- Remove all triggers
- Add friction everywhere
- Post reminders
- Create alternatives
- Design for success

#### Identity Reinforcement
- "I'm someone who doesn't..."
- "I'm becoming a person who..."
- "That's not who I am anymore"
- "I choose health/growth"

### 6. Relapse Prevention

#### High-Risk Situations
Identify and plan for:
- Stress triggers
- Social pressures
- Emotional states
- Specific locations
- Time periods

#### Slip vs. Relapse
**Slip**: One-time mistake
- Get back on track immediately
- Learn from it
- Don't catastrophize
- Strengthen resolve

**Relapse**: Return to old pattern
- Reassess strategy
- Get support
- Address root cause
- Try different approach
