# Breakthrough Coaching Task

## Purpose

Facilitate a breakthrough coaching session to help the user move past a specific challenge, obstacle, or limiting pattern that's blocking their progress.

## Instructions

### 1. Challenge Identification

Guide the user to clearly articulate their challenge:
- **What exactly** is the challenge or obstacle?
- **How long** has this been an issue?
- **What impact** is it having on their life/goals?
- **What have they tried** before?
- **What would change** if this was resolved?

### 2. Deeper Exploration

Use powerful coaching questions to explore:

#### Root Cause Discovery
- "What do you believe is really behind this challenge?"
- "If this challenge had a voice, what would it say?"
- "What purpose might this challenge be serving?"
- "What are you afraid would happen if you solved this?"

#### Pattern Recognition
- "When did you first experience something like this?"
- "What patterns do you notice in how this shows up?"
- "Where else in your life does this theme appear?"

#### Resource Inventory
- "When have you successfully overcome something similar?"
- "What strengths do you have that you're not fully using?"
- "Who in your life has overcome something like this?"
- "What resources are available that you haven't tapped into?"

### 3. Perspective Shifts

Help reframe the challenge:

#### Alternative Viewpoints
- "If your best friend had this challenge, what would you tell them?"
- "How might this challenge actually be preparing you for something?"
- "What opportunities might be hidden in this obstacle?"
- "If you were to thank this challenge, what would you say?"

#### Future Self Perspective
- "Imagine you've already solved this - what did you do?"
- "What would the wisest version of you say about this?"
- "Looking back from 5 years in the future, how will you view this?"

### 4. Solution Generation

Facilitate creative problem-solving:

#### Brainstorming Phase
- Generate 10+ potential solutions without judgment
- Include wild, impractical ideas
- Build on each idea to create variations
- Look for patterns in the solutions

#### Reality Testing
- Which solutions feel most energizing?
- What would be the smallest possible first step?
- What support would be needed for each approach?
- Which aligns best with their values and goals?

### 5. Commitment and Action

Create concrete next steps:

#### Specific Action Plan
- **First step**: What will they do in the next 48 hours?
- **Weekly actions**: What will they commit to for the next week?
- **Support systems**: Who will help hold them accountable?
- **Progress measures**: How will they track movement?

#### Obstacle Preparation
- What might get in the way of taking action?
- How will they handle resistance or setbacks?
- What will they do if motivation wanes?

### 6. Integration and Follow-up

Ensure lasting change:

#### Learning Capture
- What key insights emerged from this session?
- What patterns do they now see differently?
- What new beliefs are they adopting?
- How will they remember these insights?

#### Follow-up Plan
- When will they review progress?
- What check-ins are needed?
- How will they celebrate breakthroughs?
