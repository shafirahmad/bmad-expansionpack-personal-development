# Values Exploration Task

## Purpose

Help the user discover, clarify, and prioritize their core values to create a solid foundation for decision-making and life direction.

## Instructions

### 1. Values Discovery Process

#### Peak Experiences Analysis
Guide the user through identifying their peak life experiences:
- **Describe 3-5 times** when you felt most alive, energized, and authentic
- **What was happening?** What activities, people, environments were involved?
- **What values were being honored** in these moments?
- **What made these experiences so meaningful** to you?

#### Values in Action Recognition
Explore when values show up naturally:
- **When do you feel most like yourself?**
- **What activities energize rather than drain you?**
- **What causes do you care deeply about?**
- **What behaviors in others do you most admire?**
- **What would you stand up for, even if it was difficult?**

#### Contrast Analysis
Identify values through their opposites:
- **When do you feel most frustrated or angry?** (Values being violated)
- **What behaviors in others really bother you?** (Opposite of your values)
- **When have you felt most out of alignment?** (Values being compromised)

### 2. Values Clarification

#### Initial Values List
Present comprehensive values inventory and have user:
- Select 15-20 values that resonate strongly
- Add any missing values important to them
- Define what each value means specifically to them

#### Values Clustering
Group related values:
- **Achievement cluster**: Excellence, success, accomplishment
- **Connection cluster**: Love, family, friendship, community
- **Growth cluster**: Learning, adventure, creativity, innovation
- **Service cluster**: Contribution, helping others, making a difference
- **Security cluster**: Stability, safety, financial security
- **Freedom cluster**: Independence, choice, flexibility, adventure

#### Prioritization Process
Use multiple methods to identify top values:

**Method 1: Forced Ranking**
- Rank all selected values from most to least important
- Focus on top 10, then narrow to top 5

**Method 2: Values Tournament**
- Compare values head-to-head
- "If you could only honor one of these two values, which would you choose?"
- Continue until clear hierarchy emerges

**Method 3: Life Scenarios**
- Present challenging scenarios requiring value trade-offs
- See which values the user consistently chooses

### 3. Deep Values Definition

For each top 5-7 values:

#### Personal Definition
- **What does this value mean to you specifically?**
- **How do you know when this value is being honored?**
- **What does this look like in daily life?**

#### Behavioral Indicators
- **What specific actions demonstrate this value?**
- **What would others observe when you're living this value?**
- **What decisions does this value guide?**

#### Current Alignment Assessment
- **How well are you currently living this value (1-10)?**
- **Where do you honor it well?**
- **Where do you compromise it?**
- **What would it look like to live this more fully?**

### 4. Values Integration

#### Decision-Making Framework
Create practical application:
- **Major Decision Filter**: How does each top value influence big choices?
- **Daily Choice Guide**: How do values guide small daily decisions?
- **Conflict Resolution**: When values conflict, which takes precedence in different contexts?

#### Goal Alignment Check
Review current goals against values:
- **Which goals are deeply aligned with your values?**
- **Which goals might be out of alignment?**
- **What goals might you need to adjust or abandon?**
- **What new goals emerge from your values clarity?**

#### Life Area Application
Apply values to major life areas:
- **Career**: How do your values guide professional choices?
- **Relationships**: What values do you want to share with others?
- **Health**: How do values influence wellness decisions?
- **Finances**: How do values guide money choices?
- **Personal Growth**: Which values drive development priorities?

### 5. Values Implementation

#### Values-Based Commitments
For each core value, identify:
- **One specific commitment** to live this value more fully
- **One area where you'll stop** compromising this value
- **One relationship or situation** where you'll express this value more clearly

#### Environment Design
- **How can you design your environment** to support your values?
- **What people, places, or activities** reinforce your values?
- **What might you need to change or eliminate** that conflicts with values?

#### Regular Review Process
- **How will you regularly check alignment** with your values?
- **What will remind you** of your values daily?
- **How will you adjust** when you notice misalignment?
