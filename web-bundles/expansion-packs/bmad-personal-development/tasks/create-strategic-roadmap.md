# Create Strategic Roadmap Task

## Purpose

Build a comprehensive strategic roadmap that transforms high-level goals into actionable phases, milestones, and success metrics with clear timelines and dependencies.

## Instructions

### 1. Goal Validation & Refinement

Before creating the roadmap, ensure goals are:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Aligned**: Connected to personal vision
- **Realistic**: Achievable with stretch
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadlines
- **Exciting**: Personally motivating

### 2. Strategic Phases Definition

Break the journey into strategic phases:

#### Phase Structure:
- **Phase 1: Foundation** (Months 1-3)
  - Setup and preparation
  - Quick wins for momentum
  - Building core capabilities
  
- **Phase 2: Acceleration** (Months 4-6)
  - Scaling successful patterns
  - Increasing complexity
  - Building on foundation
  
- **Phase 3: Optimization** (Months 7-9)
  - Refining approaches
  - Maximizing efficiency
  - Preparing for next level
  
- **Phase 4: Mastery** (Months 10-12)
  - Achieving excellence
  - Sustaining gains
  - Planning next evolution

### 3. Milestone Mapping

For each phase, define:

#### Critical Milestones:
- **Leading Milestones**: Actions/efforts completed
- **Lagging Milestones**: Results achieved
- **Learning Milestones**: Insights gained
- **Capability Milestones**: Skills developed

#### Milestone Criteria:
- Binary (done/not done)
- Measurable outcome
- Clear deadline
- Dependencies identified
- Success metrics defined

### 4. Dependency Analysis

Map dependencies between:
- Goals and sub-goals
- Milestones and prerequisites
- Resources and availability
- Skills and development time
- External factors and timing

### 5. Resource Planning

Identify required resources:

#### Time Resources:
- Daily time commitment
- Weekly focus blocks
- Monthly planning time
- Quarterly review time

#### Financial Resources:
- Investment required
- ROI expectations
- Budget allocation
- Contingency planning

#### Human Resources:
- Support needed
- Expertise required
- Accountability partners
- Mentors/coaches

#### Learning Resources:
- Skills to develop
- Knowledge to acquire
- Courses/training needed
- Books/materials required

### 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Identify and plan for:

#### Risk Categories:
- **Execution Risks**: Capability, time, energy
- **External Risks**: Market, circumstances, dependencies
- **Motivation Risks**: Burnout, loss of interest
- **Resource Risks**: Financial, support, access

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Preventive measures
- Contingency plans
- Early warning indicators
- Pivot protocols

### 7. Success Metrics Framework

Define comprehensive metrics:

#### Metric Types:
- **Input Metrics**: Effort and activity
- **Output Metrics**: Direct results
- **Outcome Metrics**: Ultimate impact
- **Learning Metrics**: Growth indicators

#### Tracking Cadence:
- Daily indicators
- Weekly measures
- Monthly assessments
- Quarterly evaluations

### 8. Action Sequencing

Create logical action sequence:
1. Prerequisite actions
2. Parallel work streams
3. Sequential dependencies
4. Critical path items
5. Buffer activities

### 9. Review & Adjustment Protocol

Establish review system:
- Weekly progress checks
- Monthly milestone reviews
- Quarterly strategy assessments
- Annual vision alignment

### 10. Generate Strategic Roadmap

3. What's working better than expected?
4. What new opportunities have emerged?
5. What support do we need?
```

## Strategic Considerations

- Balance ambition with realism
- Build in flexibility for pivots
- Celebrate milestone achievements
- Learn from delays/setbacks
- Maintain strategic perspective
- Regular recalibration is normal
- Focus on progress not perfection
