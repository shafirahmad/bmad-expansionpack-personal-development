# Personal Sprint Planning Task

## Purpose

Design and implement personal sprints using agile methodology to create focused, time-boxed periods of intensive goal achievement with clear deliverables and regular retrospectives.

## Instructions

### 1. Sprint Foundation Setup

#### Sprint Duration Selection
**Standard Sprint Lengths**
- **1-Week Sprint**: For urgent goals or rapid iteration
- **2-Week Sprint**: Most common, balanced focus
- **3-Week Sprint**: Complex projects needing depth
- **4-Week Sprint**: Major initiatives or learning goals

#### Sprint Capacity Planning
**Available Time Assessment**
- Total hours available in sprint period
- Core work/life commitments
- Buffer time for unexpected events
- Realistic daily time blocks
- Energy levels throughout sprint

**Capacity Calculation**
```
Sprint Capacity = Total Hours - Fixed Commitments - Buffer (20%)
```

### 2. Sprint Goal Definition

#### Sprint Theme Selection
Choose a unifying theme:
- **Single Goal Focus**: One major objective
- **Life Area Focus**: Multiple goals in one area
- **Balanced Sprint**: Goals across multiple areas
- **Skill Development**: Learning and growth focus
- **Project Completion**: Finishing specific deliverables

#### Sprint Objective Statement
Create clear sprint objective:
- What will be accomplished
- Why it matters now
- Success criteria
- Non-negotiables
- Acceptable trade-offs

### 3. Sprint Backlog Creation

#### Task Breakdown
For each sprint goal:
1. **Decompose into Tasks**
   - Specific, actionable items
   - 1-4 hour duration each
   - Clear completion criteria
   - No dependencies on others

2. **Story Point Estimation**
   - **1 Point**: 1-2 hours, simple
   - **2 Points**: 2-4 hours, moderate
   - **3 Points**: 4-8 hours, complex
   - **5 Points**: 8+ hours, very complex
   - **8 Points**: Consider breaking down

3. **Priority Assignment**
   - **Must Do**: Core sprint commitments
   - **Should Do**: Important additions
   - **Could Do**: Nice-to-have items
   - **Won't Do**: Explicitly excluded

#### Backlog Grooming
- Remove non-essential items
- Clarify ambiguous tasks
- Identify blockers
- Sequence for optimal flow
- Balance effort across sprint

### 4. Sprint Planning Meeting (Self)

#### Planning Ceremony Structure
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

**Agenda**:
1. Review previous sprint results (5 min)
2. Confirm sprint goal and theme (5 min)
3. Select backlog items for sprint (15 min)
4. Estimate and commit to work (10 min)
5. Schedule daily activities (10 min)
6. Identify risks and mitigations (5 min)
7. Set success metrics (5 min)

#### Commitment Ceremony
- Read sprint goal aloud
- Visualize successful completion
- Commit to daily standups
- Set sprint boundaries
- Create accountability structure

### 5. Daily Sprint Execution

#### Daily Standup (5 minutes)
Answer three questions:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I complete today?
3. What obstacles am I facing?

#### Daily Planning Ritual
- Review sprint burndown
- Select today's tasks
- Block calendar time
- Prepare resources
- Set completion intentions

#### Sprint Velocity Tracking
- Tasks completed daily
- Story points burned down
- Impediments encountered
- Energy and motivation levels
- Learning and insights

### 6. Sprint Monitoring

#### Burndown Chart
Track daily:
- Remaining story points
- Ideal burndown line
- Actual progress line
- Projection to completion

#### Sprint Health Indicators
Monitor throughout:
- **Green**: On track, high energy
- **Yellow**: Some delays, moderate energy
- **Red**: Blocked, low energy

#### Mid-Sprint Adjustment
When needed:
- Reassess capacity
- Renegotiate scope
- Remove impediments
- Request support
- Maintain sprint integrity

### 7. Sprint Review

#### Accomplishment Inventory
Document completed:
- Tasks finished
- Goals achieved
- Unexpected wins
- Learning outcomes
- Value delivered

#### Demo Preparation
Prepare to showcase:
- Tangible outputs
- Progress evidence
- Before/after comparisons
- Key metrics
- Success stories

### 8. Sprint Retrospective

#### Retrospective Questions
**What Went Well?**
- Successful strategies
- Effective tools
- Good decisions
- Positive surprises

**What Could Improve?**
- Obstacles encountered
- Inefficiencies found
- Energy drains
- Missing resources

**What Will We Try?**
- New approaches
- Different tools
- Adjusted schedules
- Support strategies

#### Continuous Improvement
- Document lessons learned
- Update personal processes
- Refine estimation skills
- Adjust sprint length
- Optimize environment

## Sprint Planning Best Practices

### Setting Realistic Sprints
- Under-commit initially (70% capacity)
- Account for energy fluctuations
- Include buffer time
- Consider external factors
- Start small and build

### Maintaining Sprint Discipline
- No scope creep during sprint
- Daily standups are non-negotiable
- Time-box all activities
- Protect sprint time fiercely
- Complete retrospectives always

### Common Sprint Patterns
- **Monday Start**: Fresh week energy
- **Mid-Week Start**: Avoid Monday chaos
- **Theme Sprints**: Deep focus on one area
- **Recovery Sprints**: Lower intensity after push
- **Learning Sprints**: Skill development focus

### Sprint Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Over-committing story points
- Skipping daily standups
- Adding new work mid-sprint
- No clear sprint goal
- Missing retrospectives
- Perpetual sprint extensions
