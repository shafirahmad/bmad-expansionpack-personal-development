## Strategic Considerations

- Environment is stronger than willpower - design for success
- Small environmental changes can create massive behavioral shifts
- Focus on removing barriers rather than adding complexity
- Personalize based on your unique preferences and needs
- Test changes systematically and measure results
- Environment should serve your goals, not become a goal itself
