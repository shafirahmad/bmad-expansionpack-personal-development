# Trigger Design Task

## Purpose

Design and implement powerful environmental, temporal, and behavioral triggers that automatically initiate desired habits without relying on willpower or memory.

## Instructions

### 1. Trigger Types Overview

#### The Five Trigger Categories
**1. Time-Based Triggers**
- Specific times (8:00 AM)
- Time intervals (every 2 hours)
- Day parts (after lunch)
- Weekly patterns (Sunday planning)

**2. Location-Based Triggers**
- Entering specific rooms
- Arriving at locations
- Leaving places
- Passing landmarks

**3. Action-Based Triggers**
- After existing habits
- Before routine actions
- During transitions
- Upon completing tasks

**4. Emotional State Triggers**
- When stressed
- When energized
- When bored
- When celebrating

**5. External Cue Triggers**
- Visual reminders
- Audio signals
- Phone notifications
- Environmental changes

### 2. Trigger-Habit Matching

#### Habit Analysis
For each desired habit, identify:
- **Optimal Timing**: When most likely to succeed
- **Energy Requirements**: High/medium/low energy needed
- **Location Constraints**: Where it must/can happen
- **Duration**: How long it takes
- **Dependencies**: What's needed to perform

#### Trigger Selection Criteria
**Reliability**: How consistent is the trigger?
**Visibility**: How noticeable is it?
**Frequency**: How often does it occur?
**Context**: Does environment support the habit?
**Strength**: How compelling is the trigger?

### 3. Trigger Design Process

#### Step 1: Habit Definition
Define the habit precisely:
- Specific action to take
- Minimum viable version
- Success criteria
- Time requirement

#### Step 2: Context Mapping
Identify optimal contexts:
- Best time of day
- Ideal location
- Required mood/energy
- Necessary tools/resources

#### Step 3: Trigger Selection
Choose primary trigger:
- Most reliable option
- Natural fit with routine
- Impossible to ignore
- Positive association

#### Step 4: Trigger Enhancement
Amplify trigger power:
- Add visual cues
- Create rituals
- Stack multiple triggers
- Remove competing triggers

### 4. Environmental Design

#### Make Good Habits Obvious
**Strategic Placement**:
- Workout clothes visible
- Book on pillow
- Vitamins by toothbrush
- Water bottle on desk
- Journal by bedside

**Environmental Restructuring**:
- Rearrange furniture
- Create dedicated spaces
- Remove friction points
- Add convenience features

#### Make Bad Habits Invisible
**Friction Addition**:
- Hide temptations
- Add steps to access
- Create barriers
- Remove triggers

### 5. Digital Trigger Systems

#### Smartphone Triggers
**Notification Design**:
- Time-based reminders
- Location-based alerts
- App-specific triggers
- Calendar integration
- Widget placement

**App Configuration**:
- Morning routine apps
- Habit tracking apps
- Focus session timers
- Meditation bells
- Movement reminders

#### Computer Triggers
**Desktop Setup**:
- Browser homepage
- Bookmark bar organization
- Desktop wallpaper cues
- Startup programs
- Calendar pop-ups

### 6. Implementation Strategies

#### The 2-Minute Rule
When triggered, commit to just 2 minutes:
- Trigger fires → Start immediately
- Do minimum viable version
- Build consistency first
- Expand naturally over time

#### Trigger Chaining
Link triggers in sequence:
1. Primary trigger fires
2. Completes Habit A
3. Habit A triggers Habit B
4. Creates automatic chain

#### Implementation Intentions
"When [TRIGGER] happens, I will [HABIT] at [LOCATION]."

Examples:
- "When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do 5 pushups by my desk."
- "When I see my running shoes by the door, I will put them on immediately."
- "When my phone shows 3 PM, I will drink a glass of water."

### 7. Trigger Troubleshooting

#### Common Problems
**Trigger Ignored**:
- Make more obvious
- Add sensory element
- Change timing
- Strengthen association

**Trigger Inconsistent**:
- Choose different trigger
- Add backup trigger
- Create manual override
- Adjust expectations

**Competing Triggers**:
- Remove distractions
- Strengthen desired trigger
- Change environment
- Create clear priorities
