# Goal Quality Checklist

## Instructions for Goal Strategist Agent

Use this checklist to evaluate and improve goal quality before finalizing any goal-setting work. High-quality goals dramatically increase achievement rates and personal satisfaction.

[[LLM: GOAL QUALITY VALIDATION

This checklist ensures goals meet the highest standards for achievability, alignment, and motivational power.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Apply this rigorously to every goal before considering it complete
2. If any item fails, work with the user to improve that aspect
3. Focus on both technical quality (measurable, achievable) and personal fit
4. Don't compromise on quality for speed - better to have fewer high-quality goals
5. Use failures as learning opportunities to strengthen goal-setting skills

The goal is to create goals that naturally pull the person forward with excitement.]]
