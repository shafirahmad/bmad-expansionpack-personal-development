# Cognitive Reframing Task

## Purpose

Guide users through systematic cognitive reframing to transform limiting thoughts and perspectives into empowering, balanced, and growth-oriented thinking patterns.

## Instructions

### 1. Thought Identification

#### Catching Negative Thoughts
Help the user identify thoughts that need reframing:

**Thought Awareness Questions**
- "What specific thought keeps recurring?"
- "What story are you telling yourself about this situation?"
- "What assumption are you making?"
- "What worst-case scenario are you imagining?"
- "What self-critical message are you hearing?"

**Common Thought Patterns to Identify**
- **All-or-Nothing**: "I always..." / "I never..."
- **Catastrophizing**: "This will be a disaster"
- **Mind Reading**: "They think I'm..."
- **Fortune Telling**: "I know this will fail"
- **Personalization**: "It's all my fault"
- **Mental Filtering**: Focusing only on negatives
- **Should Statements**: "I should be better"
- **Labeling**: "I'm a failure"

### 2. Thought Examination

#### Reality Testing
Examine the thought objectively:

**Evidence Analysis**
- "What evidence supports this thought?"
- "What evidence contradicts this thought?"
- "What are the actual facts vs. interpretations?"
- "How would a neutral observer see this?"
- "What would you tell a friend thinking this?"

**Probability Assessment**
- "How likely is this outcome really (0-100%)?"
- "What's the most likely outcome?"
- "What else could happen?"
- "Has this happened before? What actually occurred?"
- "What's the best possible outcome?"

**Impact Evaluation**
- "How is this thought affecting your emotions?"
- "How is this thought affecting your behavior?"
- "Is this thought helping or hindering you?"
- "What is this thought costing you?"
- "What would change if you didn't believe this?"

### 3. Cognitive Reframing Techniques

#### The Core Reframing Process

**Step 1: Acknowledge the Original Thought**
- Write it down exactly as it occurs
- Notice the emotions it triggers
- Rate the belief strength (0-100%)

**Step 2: Challenge the Thought**
Use Socratic questioning:
- "Is this thought 100% true?"
- "Is this thought helpful?"
- "Is this thought kind?"
- "Is this thought necessary?"

**Step 3: Generate Alternative Perspectives**
Create 3-5 alternative ways to view the situation:
- More balanced perspective
- Growth-oriented perspective
- Compassionate perspective
- Opportunity-focused perspective
- Learning-focused perspective

**Step 4: Choose Empowering Reframe**
Select the most helpful alternative thought:
- Must be believable (not fake positive)
- Should promote action or acceptance
- Aligns with values and goals
- Generates better emotional state

### 4. Specific Reframing Strategies

#### From Problem to Opportunity
- **Original**: "This is a terrible problem"
- **Reframe**: "This is a challenging opportunity to grow"

#### From Failure to Learning
- **Original**: "I failed completely"
- **Reframe**: "I learned valuable lessons for next time"

#### From Victim to Agent
- **Original**: "This happened to me"
- **Reframe**: "How can I respond to this effectively?"

#### From Permanent to Temporary
- **Original**: "Things will always be this way"
- **Reframe**: "This is a temporary situation that will change"

#### From Personal to Situational
- **Original**: "I'm incompetent"
- **Reframe**: "This situation was particularly challenging"

#### From Catastrophe to Manageable
- **Original**: "This is the end of everything"
- **Reframe**: "This is difficult but manageable with the right approach"

### 5. Advanced Reframing Techniques

#### The Both/And Approach
Instead of either/or thinking:
- "I can be disappointed AND still moving forward"
- "This is hard AND I'm capable of handling it"
- "I made a mistake AND I'm still a good person"

#### The Perspective Shift
View from different angles:
- **Time Perspective**: "How will this matter in 5 years?"
- **Other's Perspective**: "How would my mentor see this?"
- **Universal Perspective**: "In the grand scheme of things..."
- **Growth Perspective**: "What is this teaching me?"

#### The Gratitude Reframe
Find something to appreciate:
- "What can I be grateful for in this situation?"
- "What strength is this developing in me?"
- "What hidden benefit might emerge?"
- "How is this protecting me from something worse?"

### 6. Integration and Practice

#### Daily Practice Structure
**Morning Intention**
- Identify one thought pattern to watch for
- Set reframing intention for the day
- Prepare go-to reframes for common thoughts

**Real-Time Reframing**
- Pause when negative thought arises
- Apply quick reframing technique
- Choose response from reframed perspective
- Note the outcome

**Evening Review**
- Journal thoughts that needed reframing
- Celebrate successful reframes
- Plan tomorrow's practice focus
- Track progress patterns

#### Building New Neural Pathways
- Repetition is key (21-66 days for habit formation)
- Write reframes for stronger encoding
- Say reframes aloud for auditory reinforcement
- Visualize acting from reframed perspective
- Celebrate each successful reframe
