# Life Wheel Assessment Task

## Purpose

Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all major life areas to establish baseline satisfaction levels, identify gaps, and prioritize areas for improvement.

## Instructions

### 1. Introduction & Setup

Explain the life wheel assessment process to the user:
- We'll evaluate 8-10 key life areas
- Rate current satisfaction from 1-10
- Identify gaps between current and desired states
- Explore interconnections between areas
- Create prioritized improvement plan

### 2. Life Areas Assessment

For each life area, guide the user through:

#### Assessment Questions:
1. **Current Rating (1-10)**: How satisfied are you with this area?
2. **Ideal Rating**: Where would you like this to be?
3. **Evidence**: What specific examples support your current rating?
4. **Impact**: How does this area affect other areas of your life?
5. **Recent Changes**: Has this improved, declined, or stayed stable?

#### Standard Life Areas:

### 3. Gap Analysis

After rating all areas:
1. Calculate gap scores (Ideal - Current)
2. Identify top 3 gap areas
3. Explore root causes of gaps

### 4. Interconnection Mapping

Help user see connections:
