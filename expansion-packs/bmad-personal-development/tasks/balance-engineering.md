## Strategic Considerations

- Perfect balance is myth - aim for dynamic balance that serves your current life season
- Different life phases require different balance approaches and priorities
- Small, consistent adjustments are more sustainable than dramatic balance overhauls
- Balance is personal - what works for others may not work for you
- Regular monitoring and adjustment prevents small imbalances from becoming major problems
- Support systems and boundaries are essential for maintaining sustainable balance
