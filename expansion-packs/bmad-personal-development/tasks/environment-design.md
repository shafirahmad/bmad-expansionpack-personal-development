# Environment Design Task

## Purpose

Strategically design physical and digital environments to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible, leveraging choice architecture to support desired behaviors automatically.

## Instructions

### 1. Environment Audit

- Homepage optimized

### 5. Implementation Strategy

#### Room-by-Room Approach
**Week 1**: Primary workspace
**Week 2**: Kitchen/eating areas
**Week 3**: Bedroom
**Week 4**: Digital environments

#### The 5-Step Process
1. **Clear**: Remove all items
2. **Categorize**: Sort by habit impact
3. **Optimize**: Apply design principles
4. **Place**: Strategic positioning
5. **Test**: Live with it, adjust
