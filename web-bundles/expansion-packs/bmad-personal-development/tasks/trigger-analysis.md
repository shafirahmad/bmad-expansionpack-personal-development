# Trigger Analysis Task

## Purpose

Map and understand the environmental, emotional, and contextual triggers that initiate both positive and negative behavioral patterns, enabling strategic trigger modification for habit optimization.

## Instructions

### 1. Trigger Mapping Framework

#### Trigger Categories
- **Environmental Triggers**: Physical locations, objects, visual cues
- **Temporal Triggers**: Times of day, days of week, seasonal patterns
- **Emotional Triggers**: Feelings, moods, stress states
- **Social Triggers**: People, relationships, social situations
- **Physiological Triggers**: Hunger, fatigue, energy levels
- **Cognitive Triggers**: Thoughts, memories, mental states

#### Behavioral Context Analysis
For each target behavior (positive or negative):
- **Pre-Trigger State**: What was happening before the trigger?
- **Trigger Event**: What specific stimulus initiated the behavior?
- **Response Pattern**: How did you respond to the trigger?
- **Post-Behavior State**: How did you feel after the behavior?
- **Environmental Context**: Where and when did this occur?

### 2. Positive Trigger Identification

#### Trigger Documentation Process
For each positive trigger:
1. **Specific Description**: Exact environmental or internal conditions
2. **Reliability Assessment**: How consistently does this trigger work?
3. **Intensity Rating**: How strong is the behavioral response?

## Strategic Considerations

- Triggers are more powerful than willpower for behavior change
- Small environmental changes can create massive behavioral shifts
- Focus on designing environments that make good behaviors automatic
- Negative triggers are often easier to modify than eliminate completely
- Positive triggers can be stacked and combined for amplified effects
- Personal trigger patterns are unique - what works for others may not work for you
