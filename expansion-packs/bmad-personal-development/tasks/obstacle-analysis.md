# Obstacle Analysis Task

## Purpose

Systematically identify, analyze, and create strategic approaches to overcome obstacles that are preventing goal achievement or life satisfaction.

## Instructions

### 1. Obstacle Identification

#### Current Obstacles Inventory
Help the user identify obstacles across categories:

**External Obstacles:**
- Time constraints
- Financial limitations
- Resource shortages
- Other people's resistance
- Systemic barriers
- Technological challenges
- Environmental factors

**Internal Obstacles:**
- Limiting beliefs
- Fears and anxieties
- Skill gaps
- Habit patterns
- Energy/motivation issues
- Past experiences/trauma
- Perfectionism/procrastination

**Hidden Obstacles:**
- Unconscious commitments
- Secondary gains from current situation
- Identity conflicts
- Values misalignment
- Competing priorities

### 2. Obstacle Prioritization

#### Impact vs. Control Matrix
For each obstacle, assess:
- **High Impact, High Control**: Priority focus areas
- **High Impact, Low Control**: Influence strategies
- **Low Impact, High Control**: Quick wins
- **Low Impact, Low Control**: Accept or ignore

#### Urgency Assessment
- **Immediate blockers**: Stopping progress right now
- **Medium-term barriers**: Will block progress soon
- **Long-term challenges**: May become issues later

#### Interconnection Analysis
- Which obstacles are connected?
- Which obstacles create or worsen others?
- Which obstacles, if removed, would eliminate others?

### 3. Deep Obstacle Analysis

For each priority obstacle:

#### Root Cause Analysis
Use "5 Whys" technique:
- **Why does this obstacle exist?**
- **Why is that the case?** (Continue 5 levels deep)
- **What's the fundamental root cause?**

#### Obstacle Biography
- **When did this obstacle first appear?**
- **How has it evolved over time?**
- **What purposes has it served?**
- **What would happen if it was completely gone?**

#### Stakeholder Analysis
- **Who benefits from this obstacle existing?**
- **Who would be affected if it was removed?**
- **What resistance might you face in removing it?**

### 4. Solution Strategy Development

#### Multiple Solution Paths
For each obstacle, generate 3-5 different approaches:

**Direct Assault**: Head-on solutions
- What would completely eliminate this obstacle?
- What resources would be needed?
- What's the timeline for this approach?

**Circumvention**: Going around the obstacle
- How could you achieve your goal without removing this obstacle?
- What alternative paths exist?
- What would this approach require?

**Transformation**: Changing the obstacle into an asset
- How could this obstacle become helpful?
- What opportunity might be hidden in this challenge?
- How could you use this obstacle's energy for your benefit?

**Gradual Erosion**: Slowly weakening the obstacle
- What small actions would chip away at this obstacle?
- How could you gradually reduce its impact?
- What would consistent small efforts achieve?

**System Change**: Changing the conditions that create the obstacle
- What underlying systems need to change?
- How could you alter the environment?
- What new structures would prevent this obstacle?

### 5. Strategy Selection and Planning

#### Strategy Evaluation
For each solution approach, assess:
- **Feasibility**: Can this realistically be done?
- **Resources Required**: What would it take?
- **Timeline**: How long would this take?
- **Risk Level**: What could go wrong?
- **Energy Cost**: How much effort is required?
- **Success Probability**: How likely is this to work?

#### Integrated Approach Design
- **Primary Strategy**: Main approach to focus on
- **Secondary Strategy**: Backup or complementary approach
- **Contingency Plans**: What if the primary strategy fails?

#### Action Planning
Create specific action steps:
- **Week 1 Actions**: Immediate next steps
- **Month 1 Milestones**: Short-term progress markers
- **Quarter 1 Goals**: Medium-term objectives
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure progress

### 6. Implementation Support

#### Accountability Structure
- **Progress Check-ins**: When and how to review progress
- **Support Partners**: Who will help with this obstacle?
- **Expert Resources**: What professional help might be needed?

#### Motivation Maintenance
- **Why This Matters**: Connect obstacle removal to deeper values/goals
- **Progress Celebration**: How to acknowledge small wins
- **Setback Recovery**: How to bounce back from failures

#### Environment Design
- **Supportive Changes**: Environmental modifications to support obstacle removal
- **Trigger Removal**: Eliminating cues that reinforce the obstacle
- **Success Cues**: Adding reminders and supports for new approaches

## Analysis Frameworks

### Obstacle Categories Reference
- **Skills**: What you don't know how to do
- **Resources**: What you don't have access to
- **Systems**: Structures that work against you
