# Habit Readiness Checklist

## Instructions for Habit Engineer Agent

Use this checklist to assess readiness before designing any new habit system. Attempting to build habits without proper readiness often leads to failure and decreased confidence.

[[LLM: HABIT READINESS VALIDATION

This checklist ensures optimal conditions for habit formation success before beginning any habit building process.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Complete full assessment before designing habit systems
2. Address readiness gaps before proceeding with habit building
3. Use low readiness as opportunity to build foundational capabilities first
4. Focus on setting up success conditions rather than forcing willpower
5. Remember that timing and readiness dramatically impact success rates

The goal is to build habits that stick, not just create ambitious plans.]]
