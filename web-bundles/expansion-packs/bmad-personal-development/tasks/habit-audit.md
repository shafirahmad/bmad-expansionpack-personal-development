# Habit Audit Task

## Purpose

Conduct a comprehensive audit of current habits to identify what's working, what's not, and what needs to change for optimal life design.

## Instructions

### 1. Current Habit Inventory

Guide the user through cataloging existing habits:

#### Daily Habits
- **Morning Routine**: List all morning habits (good and bad)
- **Work/Productivity Habits**: Regular work behaviors
- **Evening Routine**: End-of-day patterns
- **Health Habits**: Exercise, eating, sleep patterns
- **Digital Habits**: Phone, social media, screen time
- **Social Habits**: Communication, relationship patterns

#### Weekly/Monthly Patterns
- Regular weekly activities
- Monthly routines or rituals
- Seasonal patterns

### 2. Habit Classification

For each identified habit, classify as:

#### Keystone Habits
- Habits that trigger positive cascades
- High-leverage behaviors
- Identity-reinforcing habits

#### Supporting Habits
- Helpful but not transformative
- Maintenance behaviors
- Nice-to-have routines

#### Neutral Habits
- Neither helpful nor harmful
- Time-filling activities
- Automatic behaviors

#### Limiting Habits
- Energy draining
- Goal blocking
- Health compromising
- Relationship damaging

### 3. Habit Impact Analysis

For each significant habit, assess:

1. **Time Investment**: How much time per day/week?
2. **Energy Impact**: Does it give or drain energy?
3. **Goal Alignment**: Does it support or hinder goals?
4. **Identity Alignment**: Does it match who you want to be?
5. **Ripple Effects**: What else does it influence?
6. **Opportunity Cost**: What could you do instead?

### 4. Habit Stack Analysis

Examine current habit stacks:
- What habits are linked together?
- Which stacks are working well?
- Where are there broken chains?
- What triggers current stacks?

### 5. Environmental Audit

Assess environmental factors:
- What environment cues trigger good habits?
- What environmental friction exists?
- Where does environment enable bad habits?
- What environmental changes would help?

### 6. Success Pattern Recognition

Identify what makes habits stick:
- Common factors in successful habits
- Patterns in failed habit attempts
- Optimal timing for habit execution
- Best accountability methods for user

### 7. Gap Identification

Compare current habits to ideal state:
- Missing keystone habits
- Habits that need optimization
- Habits that need elimination
- New habits needed for goals

### 8. Habit Change Priorities

Create prioritized change list:

#### Immediate Changes (This Week)
- Quick wins
- Easy eliminations
- Simple optimizations

#### Short-term Changes (This Month)
- New keystone habits
- Major habit redesigns
- Environment modifications

#### Long-term Changes (This Quarter)
